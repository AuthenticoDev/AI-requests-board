# AI-requests-board

Core Idea

Create a two-column bulletin board where people post AI-powered requests and volunteers pick them up to deliver outputs. Each completed task nets the volunteer a “Help Stub” they can redeem later for someone else’s help or AI output.
What You Need

    A whiteboard/corkboard or even a blank wall

    Two stacks of index cards (or Post-its) and pens

    A simple “Help Stub” template (a blank card you tear in half)

How It Works

    Columns Setup

        Left Side – “Request”: People write on a card

            “Generate a haiku about summer storms”

            “Outline a 200-word blog intro on remote work”

        Right Side – “Volunteer”: Folks pick a Request card and move it here when they start it.

    Delivery & Reward

        When done, volunteer sticks the completed output (printed or photographed) under the Request.

        They tear off a “Help Stub” (half the card) from a stub-stack and keep it.

    Stubs as Currency

        Anytime they want an AI favor—any request from the board—they hand in a Help Stub to the original poster (or to you as organizer).

        You tear off another stub for them to spend next time: peer-to-peer exchange.

Why It Fits Your Goals

    Zero tech overhead: uses paper and wall space you already have.

    Built-in exchange: stubs are both currency and proof of contribution.

    Demand-channeling: you capture ongoing requests and funnel them to active volunteers.

    Prompt-tuning on the fly: as organizer, you can toss out “pro tips” on how to sharpen prompts, guiding everyone.

Next Steps (5 min)

    Label your board “AI Task Board” with two columns.

    Prep a stack of Request cards and matching stub-cards.

    Announce: “Any AI task you need, post it—anyone can pick it up, earn a stub, spend it later!”

Within ten minutes you have a self-sustaining, exchange-based AI creation hub, seeding both creative outputs and a little “buying-power” in the form of Help Stubs.
